A Dictionary application for Android and Firefox OS, which provide definition, examples, pronunciation & much more of the input word. The app also includes activities like ‘Word of the Day’ and ‘Match the column’ to improve the vocabulary of the user. I used Ionic Framework, which works on Angular JS and application uses open source Wordnik APIs to get the relevant data.
